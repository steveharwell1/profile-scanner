## Standard usage
To run the standard scan where new profiles are automatically found and old profile snapshots are periodically refreshed.
If you are starting a new database of profiles the scanner may not know where to start. You can use the search feature to get some initial profiles in the database.

Execute `python scanner`

## Search
The search feature will run a standard topic search on the site. All profile links will be recorded for future scanning.

Execute `python scanner -s "search text"` where you can choose the search text you like.

## Get person's history
Get an excel file of a single person's profile timeline. Each row will be a snapshot of this person's profile.
The person's id must include `https` all the way to the closing `/` as in `https://www.linkedin.com/in/personsid/`

Execute `python scanner -g "profile_link"`

## Get current profiles
Get an excel file of the most recent snapshot for each alumni. Each row will be a different person.

Execute `python scanner -c`

## Change output file
You can modify the output filename by adding on the `-o` flag to the commands that do file output.
The provided filename must end in `.xlsx`.

Example usage `python scanner -c -o my-file-name.xlsx`
